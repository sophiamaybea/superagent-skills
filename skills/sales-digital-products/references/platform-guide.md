# Digital Products Platform Guide

## Pricing strategy

| Product type | Price range | Pricing model |
|---|---|---|
| Ebook / PDF guide | $9–$49 | One-time purchase |
| Template pack | $19–$99 | One-time or bundle |
| Mini-course (< 2 hrs) | $29–$97 | One-time |
| Full course (5+ hrs) | $97–$997 | One-time or payment plan |
| Design asset pack | $9–$59 | One-time or subscription |
| Software / plugin | $29–$199 | One-time or subscription |
| Premium community | $19–$99/mo | Subscription |

**Pricing principles**:
- **Price on value, not effort** — a 2-page checklist that saves 10 hours is worth more than a 100-page ebook
- **Use anchoring** — show the "value" ($500+) before the price ($49)
- **Offer tiers** — basic ($29), standard ($49), premium ($99) — most buy the middle
- **Payment plans increase AOV** — "3 payments of $67" converts better than "$197 one-time" for courses
- **Test prices up, not down** — start higher than you think, discount later if needed

## Launch playbook

**Pre-launch (2–4 weeks before)**:
1. Tease the product to your audience (email, social)
2. Build a waitlist landing page
3. Create 3–5 pieces of free content that lead to the product topic
4. Prepare launch emails (announcement, value-focused, urgency, last call)

**Launch week**:
1. **Day 1**: Announce with early-bird pricing or founding member bonus
2. **Day 2–3**: Share customer wins, testimonials, behind-the-scenes
3. **Day 4–5**: Address objections, FAQ, detailed breakdown
4. **Day 6**: Urgency — price going up or bonus expiring
5. **Day 7**: Last call email — final reminder before deadline

**Post-launch**:
1. Collect testimonials from buyers
2. Set up evergreen sales funnel (landing page + email sequence)
3. Plan a v2 or complementary product
4. Add as an upsell/cross-sell to other products

## Product delivery

**Delivery methods**:
- **Hosted download**: Platform hosts the file, buyer gets instant access link
- **Email delivery**: Automated email with download link after purchase
- **Membership area**: Drip content over time (courses, multi-part products)
- **License key**: Software products with activation codes

**File protection**:
- **PDF stamping**: Add buyer's email to each page (deters sharing)
- **Unique download links**: Expire after X downloads or hours
- **Membership login**: Require account to access (courses, software)
- **DRM**: Heavy-handed, usually hurts legitimate buyers more than pirates

## Upsell and cross-sell strategy

| Position | Type | Example | Conversion lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Order bump** | Add-on at checkout | "+$19 for the template pack" | +15–30% revenue |
| **Post-purchase upsell** | Higher-tier offer after buy | "Upgrade to the course for $47 more" | +10–25% revenue |
| **Cross-sell email** | Related product in follow-up | "People who bought X also got Y" | +5–15% revenue |
| **Bundle** | Multiple products at discount | "All 3 guides for $79 (save $40)" | Higher AOV |
